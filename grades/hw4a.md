============

#### Notation (20/20)
  * Your diagrams conform well to our expectations on UML notation across all models. Well done.

#### Domain Model (11/16)
  * Your domain model misses a few minor concepts and relationships.
    * Poor modeling of classes vs. attribute in your domain model
    * You have unlabeled relationships which makes your model hard to understand.
  * Your domain model matches our expectations regarding the level of abstraction

#### System Sequence Diagram (8/8)
  * Your system sequence diagram matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction
  * Your system sequence diagram sufficiently models the interactions in the given scenario

#### Behavioral Contracts (4/4)
  * Your contracts reasonably describes the interface and are written at the right level of abstraction

#### Interaction Diagram (`challenge`) (16/16)
  * Your interaction diagram matches our expectations regarding modeling accuracy of the challenging interaction. Well done.
  * We have no major concerns regarding the design (e.g., responsibility assignment) of your validation interaction
  * Your interaction diagram matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction

#### Interaction Diagram (`makeMove`) (8/16)
  * Your interaction diagram roughly describes the move mechanism, but misses several major aspects of counting points or evaluating special tiles, as annotated in the model. 
    * Your diagram should start with a call on some object with parameters indicating a move
    * You do not check the physical validity of a move. Show how this interaction works
    * Your diagram should show how you get words from placed tiles
    * Your diagram should show the evaluation of special tiles
    * Special tiles should be able to modify the board, player order, and computed points
  * We have no major concerns regarding the design (e.g., responsibility assignment) of your move interaction
  * Your interaction diagram matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction

#### Object Model (16/16)
  * We have no major concerns regarding the completeness of your object model
  * In general, your object model seems reasonable from a design perspective (e.g., responsibility assignment). We have only minor suggestions for improvement, as annotated in the models.
  * We have no major concerns regarding abstraction level and use of object-oriented concepts in your object model
  * Your object model matches our expectation regarding the level of abstraction

#### Justification (4/4)
  * Your justification meets our expectations regarding vocabulary and discussion of design goals and principles, thanks.

#### Consistency (20/20)
  * We have no major concerns regarding consistency across your modeling artifacts. Well done!



You can regain up to 75% of the points lost in this milestone in Milestone C by addressing our comments and updating your design documents. If you have lost a large number of points, we recommend some interaction with the course staff. Beyond that, we do *not* pose additional questions that you need to answer for Milestone C.
