hw4c Feedback
============


#### Design of GUI and Special Tile Implementation (30/30)
  * Your implementation effectively separates the GUI from the Core.
  * Your implementation seems to completely implement the additional special tile in an extensible way. Nice job!

#### Implementation of GUI (18/40)
  * Your GUI does not display many of the key pieces of information we would expect to see while playing Scrabble.
    * Your GUI crashes when I run it.
  *  Your GUI correctly handled the various board state change events. Well done!
  * Your GUI does not contain any of the key aspects of Scrabble  gameplay.
    * I could not run it
  * Build automation using gradle and Travis CI seems to work fine, but we were unable to start your game using `gradle run`.
  * Your implementation meets our expectations regarding documentation and style.


#### Reflection on the design process (5/10)
  * You did not submit a `discussion.pdf`
