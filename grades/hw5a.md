hw5a Feedback
============


#### Description of Framework (15/15)
Your framework description is reasonably complete, good job!

#### Framework Design (20/35)
##### Basic Structure
* Your API does not describe behavior to cover exceptional cases.
* Your framework should be able to manage multiple visualization plugins simultaneously. Your design model suggests that only one plugin can be supported at a time.
* Your data plugin is not parameterized for different sources. A data plugin should be able to gather data from sources given at runtime, and create a separate object representing the data from each source.

##### Framework/Plugin Interaction and Control Flow
* It is unclear how and when framework gets the information to display the visualization plugins in the GUI.

##### Style
* The method call arguments are missing on the interaction diagram.

#### Planning (8/10)
* You did not describe how you plan to split up the work on the framework itself.
* You did not have a timeline for completing each task.
