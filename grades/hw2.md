============

#### Correctly applying the concepts of polymorphism and information hiding (/20)

* Polymorphism (15/15)

* Information Hiding (5/5)

#### Java best practices and compatibility with our informal specification (29/30)

* Part 1 (8/8)
* Part 2 (9/9)
* Part 3 (12/13)

  * Your `zero()` method does not restore your variable to its original value. This may result in unexpected results when evaluating other expressions using the same variable.

#### Unit testing, including coverage and compliance with best practices (30/30)

* Testing (12/12)
* Coverage (12/12)
* Best Practices (6/6)

#### Documentation and style (19/20)

  * Constants should be in all uppercase, separated by underscores. Ex: `VARIABLE_NAME`. ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/said/blob/master/homework/2/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw2/expression/DerivativeExpression.java#L14))

  * _minor_ Constants should be declared `static final`. ([link](https://github.com/CMU-15-214/said/blob/master/homework/2/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/cs214/hw2/expression/DerivativeExpression.java#L14))
