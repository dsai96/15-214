============


#### Implementation of Scrabble game (60/60)
  * Your implementation seems to completely or almost completely implement the functionality related to the gameâ€™s board (squares, tiles, special tiles, drawing and exchanging tiles, purchasing special tiles, making moves, etc). Well done.
  * Your implementation seems to completely or almost completely implement the functionality related to the validating a move in the game (checking placement, etc.). Well done!
  * Your implementation seems to completely or almost completely implement the functionality related to challenging a move in the game (validating words, reverting board state, etc). Well done!
  * Your implementation seems to completely or almost completely implement the functionality related to scoring a move in the game (adding points for tiles and words, applying multipliers and scoring-related special tiles, etc). Well done.
  *  Your implementation seems to completely or almost completely implement the special tiles in the game (reverse order, boom, negative points, and own tile). Well done.

#### Program Design (21/25)
  * Overall, you did a pretty good job here. My only concerns are about your responsibility assignment.
    * Game is doing everything, it should be delegating all that work. Think about what has the most information for each thing-- wouldn't it make more sense for Board to validate a Move?
   * Think about how you could have made more classes that were smaller as opposed to making your Game into a "God Class"

#### Testing and Build Automation (22/25)
  * Your testing practice meets our expectations. Well done!
  * Your testing coverage seems reasonable. 
  * Travis is not building homework 4. Please change your settings.gradle file in the top level of your repository to fix this issue.


#### Documentation and Style (5/10)
  * Please document your public classes/methods with comments. You are missing documentation in several classes.
    * You are missing several javadoc comments in the tiles package. Most importantly, in the SpecialTile interface.
